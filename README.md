# Scala Cats State

Working prototype to accompany [my medium blog post](https://medium.com/@pvinchon/taming-cats-state-dae1fb83a55e).

Implementing the full Tic Tac Toe helped identify sub-optimal suggestions. Those will be highlighted in the comments,
but the code smells will be kept. This is mostly to avoid updating the post months after publication.

### Getting started
```sh
sbt run
```
